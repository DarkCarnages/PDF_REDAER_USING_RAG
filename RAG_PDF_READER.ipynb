This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy\\n\\nwith fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the 3\\n\\ndimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads. 5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively. 8'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["rag_tool.run(\"What is this pdf about ??\") #calling rag tool to test"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0ac98c3c-b02f-4680-8fab-99fbfa3c45a3","metadata":{"id":"0ac98c3c-b02f-4680-8fab-99fbfa3c45a3"},"source":["## Mention the Tavily API Key\n","Internet search"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"id":"4e1b4e5e-a4c4-4b81-8d11-97b9f7eb1d4f","metadata":{"id":"4e1b4e5e-a4c4-4b81-8d11-97b9f7eb1d4f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737121963996,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":482,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Mulavekar","userId":"16095267443935664364"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","\n","# Set the Tavily API key\n","os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY']=\"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\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"id":"086f3f46-0750-4d59-a56a-02d13b802223","metadata":{"id":"086f3f46-0750-4d59-a56a-02d13b802223","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737121964555,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Mulavekar","userId":"16095267443935664364"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["web_search_tool = TavilySearchResults(k=3)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"id":"b445a6f5-ff84-4ee8-b633-f28be3d06b00","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"b445a6f5-ff84-4ee8-b633-f28be3d06b00","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737121965881,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Mulavekar","userId":"16095267443935664364"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# web_search_tool.run"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"RGDlmy6bSwV1","metadata":{"id":"RGDlmy6bSwV1"},"source":["**Tools are the \"how\" -** they provide the functionalities.\n","\n","**Agents are the \"who\" -** they make the decisions.\n","\n","**Tasks are the \"what\" -** they define the goals.\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d1e69851-f7e3-4b9a-8c7c-7da0f7f04bde","metadata":{"id":"d1e69851-f7e3-4b9a-8c7c-7da0f7f04bde"},"source":["## Define a Tool"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"id":"907b371c-4b24-4c80-b833-971f56ad4c1f","metadata":{"id":"907b371c-4b24-4c80-b833-971f56ad4c1f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737121967185,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Mulavekar","userId":"16095267443935664364"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["@tool\n","#  tool to indentify which tools to call\n","def router_tool(question):\n","  \"\"\"Router Function\"\"\"\n","  if 'self-attention' in question:\n","    return 'vectorstore'\n","  else:\n","    return 'web_search'"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"be17dc59-0e72-4eaa-9654-400df6cb371e","metadata":{"id":"be17dc59-0e72-4eaa-9654-400df6cb371e"},"source":["## Create Agents to work with"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"id":"6cacf6a3-7f50-49d6-9ab0-b63433d7032c","metadata":{"id":"6cacf6a3-7f50-49d6-9ab0-b63433d7032c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737121969115,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":604,"user":{"displayName":"Shreyas Mulavekar","userId":"16095267443935664364"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Intelligent agent, can understand the context and intent of the question better than simple keyword matching.\n","Router_Agent = Agent(\n","  role='Router',\n","  goal='Route user question to a vectorstore or web search',\n","  backstory=(\n","    \"You are an expert at routing a user question to a vectorstore or web search.\"\n","    \"Use the vectorstore for questions on concept related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\"\n","    \"You do not need to be stringent with the keywords in the question related to these topics.
